# Memory Game

[Check out this project here](https://tidalsana.github.io/memory-game/)

## Summary

This project was built for The Odin Project curriculum. We are assigned to replicate a matching game (sort of)...
Pretty much clicking the images in the game that aren't clicked, if we do click one that's already clicked we lose our current score.
Mainly, we deal with using hooks in React and this is a project to introduce this new concept as well as useEffect and other things.

## Things learned

Very interesting section as I was getting used to Class components, but as soon as I did, we are thrown a curveball. Getting used to an entirely new concept that does fix or at least make the process of understanding mountin, unmounting, updating, etc. In the component lifecycle. It is syntactically easier to read when using functional components compared to class components so thats good!
So far so good!
